            <p class="about-me">Hi, My name is Chris Townsend and I am a keen landscape photographer. I have always been
                interested in photography from an early age, ever since recieving a Nikon point and shoot camera.
                I reguarly like to travel and my most recent trip was to Thailand - some of the best places of scenery I
                have ever visted! I have recently started a coding course where I hope to expand my knowedge and change
                careers. This website was designed to showcase my first project, demonstrating
                that I can use HTML and CSS to build a responsive website.</p>
