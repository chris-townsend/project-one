        <p class= "about-me">Hi, My name is Chris Townsend and I am a keen landscape photographer. I have always been interested in photography from an early age, ever since recieving a Nikon point and shoot camera.
            I reguarly like to travel and my most recent trip was to Thailand - some of the best places of scenery I have ever visted! I have recently started a coding course where I hope to expand my knowedge and change careers. This website was designed to showcase my first project, demonstrating
        that I can use HTML and CSS to build a responsive website.</p>
